    <p>Here is my review of the Macbook Pro 13&ldquo; - with ForceTouch.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the quick version:</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong></p>

<ul class="fa-good">
<li>Premium feel</li>
<li>Fantastic battery life</li>
<li>Force Touch is handy</li>
<li>SSD is ludicrously fast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>

<ul class="fa-bad">
<li>It's a $2000 laptop with no touch screen</li>
<li>RAM is not upgradable</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/dev/mbp1.jpg" alt="macbook pro, hooray"></p>

<h2 id="upgrade-time">Upgrade Time</h2>

<p>My old HP laptop sucked. The battery lasted 2 hours on a good day. The viewing angle of the glorious 720p screen was about 3 degrees - beyond which the contrast washes out. It also sounds like a vacuum cleaner when something taxing is loaded - such as notepad. Even worse than the vacuum like noise, is when it stopped. Ever had to replace a heat sink on a HP laptop? You need to literally dismantle the entire laptop and spend $70 on the replacement part. After going through that ordeal, I felt I&rsquo;d earned a new laptop.</p>

<p>Doing a bit of research, the three choices for Ultrabooks seemed to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple Macbook Pro 13&rdquo;</li>
<li>HP Spectre convertible tablet-ultrabook</li>
<li>Dell XPS 13</li>
</ul>

<p>I checked out the XPS 13, but it felt as though it had been designed by accountants, then had carbon fibre patterns slapped on to make it seem cool. It was ok, but didn&rsquo;t seem interesting.</p>

<p>My Debian loving Canadian co-worker bought a HP Spectre, which is a great machine. It converts between a tablet and ultrabook, and is one of the best Windows devices on the market&hellip; which is why he runs Debian on it. Meanwhile, one of my other coworkers has spent 18 months trying to convince me that a Macbook Pro is the way to go (&ldquo;Because they &lsquo;just work&rsquo;!&rdquo; he would say, before heading down to the Apple store to get broken display replaced).</p>

<p>So, on the face of it - both the HP Spectre and the Macbook Pro are great machines. Why did I go for the Mac?</p>

<ol>
<li>The MBP allows me to do cross platform development.</li>
<li>The terminal environment is great. I write a ton of Javascript, so this makes me a happy developer.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="macbook-pro-13-initial-impressions">Macbook Pro 13 - Initial Impressions</h2>

<p>One of the first things I noticed about the Mac Book Pro (MBP) was the build quality. Apple use the &ldquo;Unibody&rdquo; manufacturing process, which consists of getting a block of aluminium, and using a CNC machine to cut out the case. This gives a case with no seams - other than access panels added for installing components. The end result is a laptop that feels like a solid object, rather than a collection of parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The end result is a laptop that feels like a solid object, rather than a collection of parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything about this machine gives the impression that someone has put a lot of thought into it.  Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cooling vent is hidden behind the hinge</li>
<li>the power adaptor has two unfolding brackets for wrapping the cord around</li>
<li>the power adaptor comes with a short plug and a swappable long extension cord</li>
<li>the screen has a small rubber gasket running around it (rather than small rubber pads - which tend to fall off and get lost). This makes the close mechanism feel nicer</li>
<li>the keyboard backlighting is fully adjustable, rather than just on or off</li>
</ul>

<p>All parts of this machine feel premium. Take the keyboard as an example. The keys are plastic (in contrast to the aluminium case), and I wondered why they didn&rsquo;t try to make them match the case. The HP Spectre shows why. It has &ldquo;faux metal&rdquo; keys - and it just doesn&rsquo;t quite look right (in all other respects, the Spectre is a beautiful machine).</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>

<p>The specs of this particular MBP are:</p>

<p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core I5 2.7GHz (turbo boost to 3.4GHz)<br />
<strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB DDR3 <br />
<strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel Iris 6100 1.5GB VRAM<br />
<strong>Storage:</strong> 256MB SSD <br />
<strong>Display:</strong> 13.3&rdquo; 2560 x 1600 IPS panel<br />
<strong>Network:</strong> 802.11ac<br />
<strong>Optical Drive:</strong> Not included<br />
<strong>Camera:</strong> 720p</p>

<p>Overall, that is not bad. The only real weak point is the Intel graphics. The MBP can run Portal 2 just fine, and Minecraft (as long as you don&rsquo;t get carried away with shaders). If you fire up something like Battlefield 4, expect a low frame rate.</p>

<h3 id="retina-display">Retina Display</h3>

<p>Apple fans have been harping on about the retina display for years. It quickly becomes apparent why. At the default scaling setting, roughly twice as many pixels are used as a non-retina display. The result is that screen elements are the same size, but everything has a sharper look. OSX seems to do a much better job of anti-aliased fonts than Windows - making writing code much easier on the eyes.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/dev/mbp7.jpg" alt="ity bity pixels"></p>

<p>The only fault the screen has, is that it isn&rsquo;t a touch screen. A touch screen would be nice - but OSX just isn&rsquo;t built for touch at this point. The main two competitors for the MBP - the HP Spectre and the Dell XPS 13 - both offer retina class touch displays, but as extra cost options that push the price past that of the MBP (note that even the cheaper low res Spectre screen has touch).</p>

<h3 id="force-touch">Force Touch</h3>

<p>Force Touch is a nifty feature you may have heard about. Apple have removed the moving &lsquo;click&rsquo; assembly from their track pads, and replaced it with a simulated &lsquo;click&rsquo;. They achieved this using small motors capable of generating haptic feedback - the same tech offered in some smart phones.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/dev/mbp2.jpg" alt="track pad"></p>

<p>I was initially skeptical but in day-to-day use, I can&rsquo;t tell the difference between force touch and a &lsquo;real&rsquo; track pad. No big deal right? the draw card is that the track pad can sense the amount of force being used. Apple have used this to enable the strength of the track pad click to be configurable - which is nice. Additionally, they have provided an extra type of input. If you hold your finger on the pad after clicking, and push a little harder - you feel a deeper click (which apple call a Force Touch).</p>

<p>The Force Touch option is context sensitive. In finder it will preview the file you have selected. If you force touch a docked app, it will reveal the window. Although these short cuts are nice, the big draw card will be pressure sensitivity. Being able to sketch in Photoshop with a stylus is a a killer feature for art/design type people.</p>

<h3 id="ports-ports-ports">Ports ports ports</h3>

<p>After Apple released the MacBook (with a single USB-C port), it seemed they&rsquo;d gone mad. &ldquo;You want to charge your laptop <strong>and</strong> use a USB device? Bah!&rdquo; The madness has <strong>not</strong> been extended to the MBP.</p>

<p>Apple has provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 USB 3 ports (on opposite sides, so double USB external hard drives will be less than great)</li>
<li>1 HDMI port</li>
<li>SD Card reader</li>
<li>2 Thunderbolt2 ports</li>
</ul>

<p>While on paper Thunderbolt2 sounds awesome for video, external drives, and docking stations - in practice anything carrying the Thunderbolt badge costs a bloody fortune. Good thing we have USB3 ports as well!</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/dev/mbp3.jpg" alt="useful ports, and firewire"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>On first boot, Windows users are taken to a strange and confusing place where we add all of our external accounts. OSX is nice enough to integrate with Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Linked In. Unfortunetely OSX does not like 2 step auth on a Google account, so I had to force kill Safari to progress.</p>

<h3 id="free-apple-software">Free Apple Software</h3>

<p>Having had none of the anti-trust problems Microsoft have dealt with, Apple are free to bundle free things. Out of the box, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos (replaces &ldquo;iPhoto&rdquo; apparently)</li>
<li>iTunes (don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s actually really nice on a mac)</li>
<li>Garage Band (makes music, but not good music when I use it)</li>
<li>Office Software (not MS Office, but seems ok)</li>
<li>iMovie</li>
<li>Maps</li>
</ul>

<p>Maps is surprisingly great, and shows off the visual prowess of OSX. It spins, scales, and zooms around with none of the disjointed choppyness of Google Maps (or that other one&hellip; Bong Maps or something).</p>

<p>One odd omission is drawing software. There is nothing like MSPaint, and apparently nothing like Paint.Net exists for OSX.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-store">The App Store</h3>

<p>All of your software purchases and updates happen via the app store - which seems a bit more competent than Windows Update. Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve escaped reboots though. OSX still needs a restart after some patches.</p>

<p>The app store is virtually identical to what you have in IOS. It takes most of the pain away from installing and updating. For apps you can&rsquo;t find on the app store, OSX can run *nix apps.</p>

<h2 id="the-2-month-update">The 2 month update</h2>

<p>I neglected to post this review for 2 months. Mostly because I thought the last thing the internet needs is another person gushing about Apple Hardware. On the upside, I can now give an update of how the MBP has performed after 2 months.</p>

<p>The issues I&rsquo;ve encountered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Safari decided to download 2Gb of data over my tethered phone yesterday. Why? Who knows. It may be something to do with Gmail. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m back to using Chrome. I&rsquo;ve discovered this app - <a href="https://www.tripmode.ch/">Tripwire</a>, which allows me to selectively block/allow apps internet access.</li>
<li>Sometimes gestures stop working on resume. The log provides no help. Putting the MBP to sleep and waking it up again seems to fix the issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. 2 months after completely changing hardware and operating systems, those are the only issues I have had.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>This laptop is the best purchase I have ever made. I have absolutely no regrets. I rate this <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> bananas.</p>

    <p>Is your cupboard (or other) door scraping against the frame? All you need to fix it is a power plane (the type with a blade, not wings).</p>

<p>You can use a regular manual plane, but why would you? Power tools are fun.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-rubbing-door">The Problem - Rubbing Door</h2>

<p>Here is a photo of my linen cupboard. I&rsquo;ve circled the problem. The left hand door is scraping the other door. No amount of hinge adjustment or other messing around is going to fix this, we have to modify the door.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-1.jpg" alt="Our door is too big" /></p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-it">How to Fix it</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-mark-out-the-door">Step 1. Mark out the door</h3>

<p>Grab a ruler and draw a line, marking the amount of wood you want to remove. Note that if it is a hollow core door, there is a limit to how much you can remove. A few millimeters is going to be fine, but don&rsquo;t start taking huge chunks out. The door pictured is a hollow core door.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m removing about 1mm, to keep the gap between the doors as uniform as possible.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-2.jpg" alt="marking the door" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-remove-door">Step 2. Remove Door</h3>

<p>How to do this will vary depending on the type of hinge you have, but it is generally a matter of undoing the hinge screws, while not dropping the door on yourself.</p>

<p>If you are going to drop a door on yourself, try to ensure it is a hollow core door - they weigh far less than a solid core door.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-plane-the-door">Step 3. Plane the door</h3>

<p>Lay the door down so that the face you are planing is flat and easy to run the plane over. Ensure your power plane is set to take off a <em>small</em> amount of material (I went with a 0.2mm setting). This is to reduce the chance of damaging your door.</p>

<p>When you do plane the door, the direction should be from <strong>the outside in</strong>. When you lift the plane (after shaving some timber off), you should still to be on the door.</p>

<p>Keep planing until you reach the line you made in step 1.</p>

<p>If you run the plane the other way (off the end of the door), you greatly increase the chance of taking chunks out. This means your door will either be destroyed - or just look crap. You would need to use filler to fix it.</p>

<p>{% raw %}
<div class="bg-warning messagebox round"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle left pad 10"></i><strong class="leftpad5">Warning</strong>
<div class="pad10">A power plane is an unforgiving tool. It has a very sharp blade that rotates at 16,000 RPM. It is just as happy shaving your leg as it is shaving timber. Wear eye and ear protection, keep kids and pets away - and pay attention at all times.</div>
</div>
{% endraw %}</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-3.jpg" alt="plane goes this way" /></p>

<h3 id="step-4-admire-your-handywork-rehang-door">Step 4. Admire your handywork, rehang door</h3>

<p>Have a look at your door. Ensure you have taken off the right amount of material. I found that I needed to give the newly planed surface a quick sand with some 150 grit sandpaper to smooth it over a little (I probably need to sharpen my plane more often).</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-4.jpg" alt="nicely doored" /></p>

<p>Once you are satisfied, refit the door. Check that it now opens correctly. If not, take it down and go plane some more.</p>

<p>Update: @MaximRouiller informed me that I did not have a picture of the rehung door. Here it is&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-5.jpg" alt="rehung door" /></p>

<h3 id="step-5-paint">Step 5. Paint</h3>

<p>The final thing to do is repaint the planed edge of the door. Doors are usually painted with a high gloss enamel. If you want to match the paint, get a piece of paint that your plane has taken off, and have it matched at your local paint / hardware store.</p>

<p>Now you know how to fix a scraping door.</p>

    <p>Performance issues in a JS app can be frustrating&hellip; especially when your app is convoluted soup of data-bound observables. Today I discovered a performance gremlin. I&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of finding it and rectifying it.</p>

<h2 id="the-symptoms">The Symptoms</h2>

<p>My team have been working on a large javascript application. We deployed it to a new environment, and started going through some shakedown tests. All seemed to be going well&hellip; until I loaded a certain view. Then I waited&hellip; and waited. 7 seconds later, the view loaded. I reloaded with a different set of test data. This time the wait was 12 seconds.</p>

<p>That view had worked fine in our lower level environments (loading in under 1 second), what was going on?</p>

<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>

<p>The first order of business was to fire up the Chrome profiler. The profiler has an option for tracking heap allocations. The way it works is by taking a snap shot of js objects currently in memory, and comparing it to a 2nd snapshot taken at the end of the profile.</p>

<p>The profiler gives us a way to examine all objects retained (not cleaned up by the garbage collector). This is advantageous in two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have a memory leak</li>
<li>The app is spending an unexpectedly long time doing something</li>
</ol>

<p>With the profiler fired up, and a profile completed - I started examining the output. The <strong>Total Cost</strong> column shows us the <strong>%</strong> of total profiled time spent on a line of code. With this in mind, I started at the top (100%) and looked for any large sudden drops in that value. A large drop in value indicates that (for the given line) a function call made in that code path has consumed a large amount of your total cost.</p>

<p>My culprit quickly became obvious:</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/dev/perf4.png" alt="chrome profiler"></p>

<p>Notice the sudden drop from 100% to 50.52%? and a bit further down we can see the second code path - at 49.26%.</p>

<p>In both cases, out problem line is the <strong>place()</strong> method in the boot bootstrap-datetimepicker.js library.</p>

<h2 id="the-cause">The Cause</h2>

<p>Here is the function concerned. I&rsquo;ve highlighted the problem line:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="3"><code class="language-javascript">
if (!this.zIndex) {
                var index_highest = 0;
                $('div').each(function () {
                    var index_current = parseInt($(this).css("zIndex"), 10);
                    if (index_current > index_highest) {
                        index_highest = index_current;
                    }
                });
                this.zIndex = index_highest + 10;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>That line shows a jQuery selector querying <strong>every single div</strong> on the page to get the z-index. Once it finds it, the datepicker adds 10 to the value and uses that as its own z-index. Why would it do that? Simple - so the popup calendar will always display on top of any other page content.</p>

<p>There are some problems with this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date picker calendar is going to display on top of all other elements - including dialogs, overlays, or any other obnoxious controls you are using.</li>
<li>block elements other than divs can have a z-index too, so the code might not get the highest z-index anyway.</li>
<li>Single page apps typically have a ton of views in memory at any time, which are in the DOM, but not currently visible. That could be a lot of divs to iterate through!</li>
</ul>

<p>Just how many divs could this thing be looking at?</p>

<p><img class="blog-img " src="/images/dev/perf3.png" alt="oh dear"></p>

<p>1746.</p>

<p>Now consider that the jQuery selector is being run for <em>every date picker on the page</em>. Life gets painful fast.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<p>The current version of the date picker has a way to set the z-index via a property. If we set a z-index, we bypass that problematic jQuery selector.</p>

<p>I went ahead set the z-index to a suitably high value, and reloaded the view.</p>

<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>

<p>The view loaded in under 1 second, and I rode off into the sunset.</p>

    <p>Don&rsquo;t let a scraping, dragging door ruin your day. Let&rsquo;s replace the rollers!</p>

<p>Before you start, clean the track your door runs on. Your door may be scraping or dragging due to being caught on something. Have a good look at the raised &lsquo;rail&rsquo; the door roller sits on. If this is worn down too low, you&rsquo;ll need a whole new door track, not just a replacement roller.</p>

<h3 id="removing-the-door">Removing the Door</h3>

<p>Assuming the problem <em>is</em> your door roller - the first order of business is to remove the door. If it is a large glass door, it will weigh approximately 1 metric-shit-tonne. If you have help, use it.</p>

<p>Before removing the door, clear a space for it. It sucks to remove the door <em>then</em> realise you have nowhere to put the door down. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to put down a blanket to protect your floors. Metal framed doors can have sharp edges, and will happy scratch a deep groove into a timber or bamboo floor.</p>

<p>The actual removal process is fairly easy. Simply lift the door up into the frame - then (while keeping the door suspended in the air), bring the base of the door in towards you, as in the diagram below.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_removal_101.png" alt="removing the door" /></p>

<p>Once you have it out, lay the door on the long side. You&rsquo;ll find a screw. This screw will either be attached directly to the roller assembly, or pulling the door frame tight and clamping the roller assembly in place.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers2.jpg" alt="door rollers" /></p>

<p>Once you remove the screw, the roller assembly should slide out. Examine the roller wheel for wear and dirt. It may be worn down (you will need a new one). After cleaning any dirt out, it should spin freely. If not, you need a new one. If it does spin freely, it may have been sitting too high in the door.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers6.jpg" alt="old and new door rollers" /></p>

<p>If you need a new roller assembly, take the old one to a hardware store, and find the matching replacement part. Keep in mind that <em>your house is missing a door</em>, which will make it pretty easy for thieves - so hurry.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-the-roller-assembly">Replacing the roller assembly</h3>

<p>Putting the new roller assembly in simply reverses the process. Pay careful attention to how high the roller is sitting <strong>before</strong> you put the screw back in and tighten.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers4.jpg" alt="new door roller" /></p>

<p>The roller needs to be sticking out the door enough that the door will move freely without scraping. Too high and you won&rsquo;t be able to get the door back in the frame. In my case, having the rollers protrude 3mm worked perfectly.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-windows">What about windows?</h3>

<p>Window rollers are replaced exactly the same way - assuming you have modern sliding windows. The only difference is that a window weighs less than a door, so it is easier to lift out.</p>
