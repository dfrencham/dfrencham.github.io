So you need to install something on the wall, but you can't find a stud? (a timber upright). There's a way! Let's use some drywall anchors.

<!--more-->

Let me introduce you to the last dry wall anchor you will ever need:

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/ez-anchor.jpg" alt="Ez-Anchor" /></div>

This is the *BuildEx Ez-Anchor*. Unlike lesser wall anchors, this one can hold 10kg (or more if you buy the nickel rather than Nylon version). If you use a couple, that's 20kg worth of support - approximately 1 child or 5 cats.

## Instructions? bah

There is "correct" way to install these things, but it doesn't involve power tools and results in failure. I'll show you a way that works.
