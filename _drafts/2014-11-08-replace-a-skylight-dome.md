Let's replace our crappy old acrylic dome skylight.

## Skylights are not always standard sized

My house came with a 30 year old dome skylight. Rain, hail, even sufficiently sized bird crap made me nervous. I was worried, that one day my skylight would turn into a sky hole - which would devalue my property and may even let rain in.

Should be easy to swap out right? just order one the same size, right?

Nope.

The size I have is 1200x700(ish), and that size is not made any more. On the upside, we can replace the dome with a much better *tempered glass skylight*, made by Velux (and available from Bunnings). The way we can do it, is to buy a bigger skylight than the model being replaced. Then we make a collar, which will sit on top of the existing skylight frame.

## Which Skylight do I need to buy?

Buy one that is both taller and wider than the model being replaced. When measuing your skylight, you will need to get on the room and measure from the edge of the dome (including the flashing securing it in place). At the same time, verify that there is actually a "lip" supporting the dome.

If your existing model does not have this lip, then this method will not work.

Buy the size closest to the old model as you can find. Don't bother getting a fancy model, just a plane one that doesn't open or have a curtain attached, or anything. Keep things easy.

## Building the collar

My initial plan was to use aluminium L-channel to build the collar. I used my sliding mitre saw to cut the L-channel. Since aluminium is a soft metal, it cuts just fine with the wood blade. Make sure you wear safety glasses, and a face shield if you have one. As with all cutting, the material being cut can catch and be flung by the blade. A sharp aluminium off-cut in the face could kill you, or at least ruin your day.

I mitred all 4 sides, positioned inside the skylight, and screwed into place.
