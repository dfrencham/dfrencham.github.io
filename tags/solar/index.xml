      <description>Last time I set up inverter monitoring for my Aurora solar inverter, it had a lot of moving parts. I had a RaspberryPi ModelB hosting utilities writing to CSV files, which were periodically scooped up by a monitoring service. The monitoring service had a bit of setup and a few issues, but in the end it would get the data up to PVOutput.org.
This time around I decided to cut out all the bullshit and write to the PVOutput API with as little fuss as possible.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had some solar panels installed last year. I wanted to read my inverter statistics, but I also wanted to log exactly how much power I import/export. Challenge - I can&amp;rsquo;t physically plug anything into the meter (power company regulations). What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a web cam, raspberry pi, and OCR?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuation of Raspberry Pi Solar Data Logger article. In this part I detail the software side of the OCR solar data logger. Perl, APIs, C. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
