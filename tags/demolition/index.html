    <p>Ever had to remove wall tiles from plasterboard (gyprock) ? It sucks. It tears up the surface. It takes forever. Is there an easier way? Yes.</p>

<h2 id="yay-power-tools">Yay, power tools</h2>

<p>Why remove tiles one at a time, <strong>when we can remove all of them at once</strong>!? All you need is the humble multi-tool. First, some warnings:</p>

<p>{% raw %}
<div class="bg-warning messagebox round"><strong>Warning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you wear appropriate safety gear.</li>
<li>Turns off your mains power first, just in case you hit electrical wiring.</li>
<li>A large panel of wall tiles can be heavy, have a friend help you lift it down.</li>
</ul>
</div>
{% endraw %}</p>

<h3 id="cut-it-out">Cut it out</h3>

<p>All you have to do is cut a square around your patch of tiles. This square should start and finish over an upright - to make re-plastering easier. Try and keep the cuts as straight as possible. Watch out for electrical wires and water pipes. You probably should avoid hitting the tiles with your multi-tool blade, as they can send sharp porcelin shards into your face.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/removewalltile01.png" alt="Cut that sucker out" /></div>

<h3 id="lift-it-down">Lift it down</h3>

<p>You might need a mate to help lift the tiles down. Large numbers of tiles are heavy. Try to keep it in one piece, as you can use it as a template for the new sheet of dry wall. Just lay it down on the new sheet, and use it to mark out where to cut. When cutting, knock off 2mm extra on each side. That will give you some adjustment space when attaching to the wall.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/removewalltiles03.jpg" alt="Tiles after removal" /></div>

<h3 id="walls-gone-wild">Walls gone wild</h3>

<p>Here is my wall, sans plaster. See all those wires running sideways? that&rsquo;s bad. They should come straight down from the ceiling. This is why you should turn the power off <strong>before</strong> cutting.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/removewalltiles04.jpg" alt="Naked wall" /></div>

<h3 id="slap-it-up">Slap it up</h3>

<p>At this point you are going to want to put your new piece of dry wall in. Use plaster board screws to secure it to the studs, then put some mesh tape over the joins. Give the joins a coat of <a href="http://www.gyprock.com.au/Pages/Products/DIY/Multi-Purpose-Joint-Compound-Technical.aspx">Gyprock Multipurpose Joint Compound</a> or similar. The <a href="http://www.gyprock.com.au/Pages/Resources/DIY-Guides.aspx">Gyprock Homepage</a> has full guides. Too easy. Get yourself a beer.</p>

    <p>If you want your floor to be really really flat, it&rsquo;s hard to go past a concrete grinder&hellip; at least if you can get the bloody thing into your car.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder01.jpg" title="Dusthood. Ghetto MacGuyver would be proud. "><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder01.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline textwrap-left" alt="Dusthood" /></a></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pick up from my last post - where I was <a href="/diy/2014/08/27/removing-tiles">removing floor tiles</a>. I thought I was almost done, and could just finish up with an angle grinder. Then I realised I had more left over thin set left than I had thought. This was going to take a very long time. My DIY dusthood probably wouldn&rsquo;t last that long either.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p><br class="clear" /></p>

<h2 id="we-need-a-bigger-grinder">We need a bigger grinder</h2>

<p>What I needed was a really big angle grinder with diamond blades. These exist&hellip; they are &ldquo;Concrete Floor Grinders&rdquo;. I got in touch with Kennards Hire, who had a shiny looking floor grinder that would fold and fit in my car. The downside is that they wanted about $500 for 24 hours.</p>

<p>I discovered a cheaper hire place - <a href="http://www.brisbanehire.com.au/">Brisbane Hire</a>, who are actually based in Stafford. Maybe they should be called Stafford Hire? Anyhow - they will hire a floor grinder for $170 for <strong>the whole weekend</strong>. Fantastic. I booked it, and organised a pickup time.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder02.jpg" title="Why didn't I buy an SUV?"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder02.jpg" style="width:150px;height:200px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline textwrap-left" alt="Small car, big grinder" /></a></p>

<h3 id="picking-up-the-grinder">Picking up the grinder</h3>

<p>The Grinder was large, heavy, and did not have folding handles. The staff at Brisbane Hire offered to help get it in my car. You could almost taste the disappointment when they discovered I have a 4 door family car. It took 4 people to get the thing into my car. Getting the grinder back into my car single handedly at 11pm on a Sunday night was a whole other story.</p>

<p><br class="clear" /></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-and-grinding">Setting up and grinding</h3>

<p>After using the angle grinder, I was expecting a lot of dust (even with the floor grinder having a dust extraction port). I hired a 300mm extraction fan with a 10m duct, taped everything off, and raised my router to safety.</p>

<p>I connected up a Ryobi shop vac to the floor grinder, and hit the switch.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t very loud - the shop vac was louder. Despite the weight, the grinder moved around fairly well.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder03.jpg" title="Router moved to a safe spot"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder03.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Router moved to a safe spot" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder04.jpg" title="Grinder and Shopvac"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder04.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Grinder and Shopvac" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder05.jpg" title="grind grind grind"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder05.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="grinding" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder06.jpg" title="I've run out of captions"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder06.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="more grinding" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stop in one spot too long, you will gouge the concrete.</li>
<li>Do not use without a shop vac, the dust is unbelievable.</li>
<li>If you have more than one set of blades, use the rougher blades first, then the finer blades to get a smoother finish.</li>
<li>If the thin set is thick, it will take multiple passes to get through. It is faster to have a mate hitting the the thicker patches with a demo hammer, or hammer drill and chisel while you drive the floor grinder around</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t rush this thing. It moves at the speed it wants to go at, regardless of how hard you push.</li>
<li>It is large and heavy. Be careful when close to the walls. You will take chunks out if you hit them with the handle.</li>
<li>Brush the area frequently, so you can see if you have missed patches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, it was pretty easy to use, even for a complete novice. For reference, it took about 5 hours to cover 75sqm.</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder07.jpg" title="Smooth"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder07.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Smooth" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder08.jpg" title="Smoother"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder08.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Smoother" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/floorgrinder09.jpg" title="Smoothest"><img src="/images/sm_floorgrinder09.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Smoothest" /></a></p>

<p>Not bad, eh? Now it is ready to have a floating floor laid on top.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Jared, who spent half his weekend helping with the grinding.</p>

    <p>How hard can it be to remove a few floor tiles? Harder than you think&hellip;. and it will take longer&hellip; and it will be dusty. I&rsquo;ll show you the hard way, then the slightly less hard way.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/removetiles13.jpg" title="Tiles tenting"><img src="/images/sm_removetiles13.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline textwrap-left" alt="2 tiles lifting up" /></a>
First, a story. I was sitting down for dinner in my house recently. My house is a glorius monument to the 1980&rsquo;s with a fetching pink kictchen, and matching blue counter tops. I also have (had) 75sqm of white tiles - which match the white walls, white trim, and white ceilings. I was eating dinner when I heard a strange cracking sound. A few minutes later my tiles started lifting up off the floor.</p>

<p>Why would 25 year old tiles start lifting off the floor? 3 reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>the original tiler was an idiot who did not set them properly</li>
<li>the tiles were jammed against the skirting boards, and had no expansion joints</li>
<li>I installed heating. The slab was cold, but the air temperature was a nice 24C</li>
</ul>

<p>A bad tiling job that can&rsquo;t expand or contract when the temperature changes has nowhere to go except up, and up it went.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-remove-the-tiles">Should I Remove the tiles?</h2>

<p>I briefly considered re-laying the same tiles - but if I was going to re-tile, why use the same dull 80&rsquo;s tiles? New tiles with professional installation looked to be about $100sqm&hellip; or $7500 probably more like $10k. Ouch! I discovered I could get some awesome bamboo floating floors for $34sqm. To lay a floating floor, the tiles would need to be removed.</p>

<p>Before removing the tiles, let&rsquo;s have a look at how tiles are usually fixed to the slab. The tiler will use a mortar-like mix called &ldquo;thinset&rdquo; to glue the tiles to the slab. The tiler does this by mixing the thinset, then using a specially shaped trowel to spread it onto the slab. The tiles are then laid on the wet thinset, and aligned using small clips (spacers).</p>

<p>Once the thinset has bonded to the concrete and tile (generally at least a day), the tiler will come back and put down grout between  the tiles.</p>

<p>Ideally, the thinset has bonded properly. The grout will prevent lateral (sideways) movement of the tiles.</p>

<p>There are a few different types of thinset:</p>

<ul>
<li>mortar like thinset, much like the mortar used between bricks. It may or may not crumble away when power tools are used on it.</li>
<li>fortified - like standard thinset, but tougher. It is getting closer to concrete strength.</li>
<li>flexbond - contains polymer, allowing for movement in the tiles. It may prevent cracking or lifting.</li>
</ul>

<div class="box-danger pad10"> <h4></h4> <p>If your tiles were laid prior to the 80's, the thinset may contain asbestos. In rare cases, tilers may have used old thinset supplies containing asbestos into the 80's. If there is a chance you have asbestos present, get it tested and call in the professionals. Tiles are not worth death or sickness.</p> </div>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/removetiles08.jpg" title="I can't wait until he is old enough to mow the lawn"><img src="/images/sm_removetiles08.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline textwrap-left" alt="lifting tiles with a spade" /></a>
I started lifting tiles, and they were lifting easily. In some cases, I could use a spade to lever them up. The thinset was another matter. It seemed incredibly tough to shift.</p>

<p>Being a developer, I started by googling, and found this page: <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/16950/do-i-have-to-remove-the-old-thinset-before-installing-new-tile">StackExchange on tile removal</a>.</p>

<p>That page gives the impression that a rotary hammer drill (power chisel) or angle grinder with wire brush will make short work of it. I already owned a rotary hammer drill. I grabbed a cheap grinder from bunnings, with the meanest looking wire brush I could find.</p>

<p>Removing thinset will throw up a ton of dust. Use plastic drop sheets ($1 from bunnings) to block doorways and furniture. Try and keep the dust confined to your work area.</p>

<p>While using power tools, make sure you wear a respirator or class 2 dust mask, along with hearing and eye protection.</p>

<div class="box-danger pad10"> <h4></h4> <p>Concrete dust is not nice stuff. It contains silicates which are known to cause various lung conditions. It's probably carcinogenic too. Make sure you wear a respirator while working AND while cleaning up.</p></div>

<h3 id="tool-1-rotary-hammer-drill">Tool 1: Rotary Hammer Drill</h3>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/removetiles12.jpg" title="Our hero using a Rotary Hammer Drill"><img src="/images/sm_removetiles12.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline textwrap-left" alt="Me, using a hammer drill to remove tiles" /></a></p>

<p>The first tool I tried was my rotary hammer drill. For those who haven&rsquo;t seen one, it is the bigger, meaner brother of a hammer drill. A regular hammer drill can hammer while drilling and uses normal size drill bits. A rotary hammer drill can hammer while drilling, as well as hammering without spinning. This means you can put chisel attachments in it, and go to town.</p>

<div class="box-tip pad10"> <h4></h4> Heat is the enemy of the rotary hammer drill. I have managed to set two Aldi Hammer Drills on fire by working too long without letting the drill cool down. I have an Ozito now, which so far has survived the abuse I have thrown at it. The tip here is to let the drill cool down periodically.</div>

<p>I used a 20mm spade bit, and enlisted the help of my mate Jared. It turns out that removing 75sqm of tiles with a rotary hammer drill takes a very, very long time. We only got one third or less of the area done (in 1 day), and managed to snap the spade bit. I also discovered I had a second type of thinset that was a bastard mix of mortar and tar. Tiles bedded on that stuff did not lift and had to be smashed apart with the hammer drill.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: Get something bigger</strong></p>

<h3 id="tool-2-angle-grinder-with-wire-brush">Tool 2: Angle Grinder with Wire Brush</h3>

<p>If you believe Stack Exchange, this tool is all rainbows and fairies - ripping up thinset without any issue. At my house it just produced massive showers of sparks every time it hit thin set. This is not good. Sparks mean the brush is being ground away. I destroyed 90% of the brush within 5 minutes. This is the Windows Vista of tools&hellip; full of promises, but only brings disappointment.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: Epic fail</strong></p>

<h3 id="tool-3-trolley-mounted-demolition-hammer">Tool 3: Trolley Mounted Demolition Hammer</h3>

<p>I decided to bring in the big guns. I hired a Trolley Jack Hammer from Kennards with a &lsquo;Tile Smasher&rsquo; attachment. Kennards call it a &ldquo;vinyl lifter&rdquo;, but the tool actually has &ldquo;Tile Smasher&rdquo; written on it. This jack hammer was great. I put it on the maximum height setting and started smashing through. You can&rsquo;t rush this machine, or you wil just have to go back and have a second go. Slow and steady, guide it along. I found that I frequently had to lift the trolley up off the ground to get enough angle - which is less bad than you may think, as this thing has a built in shock absorber!</p>

<p>Again, heat is the enemy. Make sure you let the attachment cool down. I worked 15 minutes at a time, then spent 5 minutes clearing debris while the tile smasher cooled down. Some websites suggest cooling it in water. I&rsquo;m sure it is expensive, so better to be cautious.</p>

<p>The total cost was about $170 for 24 hours hire (this included the jack hammer and the attachment).</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: Get this</strong></p>

<h3 id="tool-4-angle-grinder-with-diamond-grinding-wheel">Tool 4: Angle grinder with diamond grinding wheel</h3>

<p>I still had a few missed patches with thinset left (I had to rush with the jackhammer), so I&rsquo;ve been using an angle grinder with a diamond grinding cup wheel. Bunnings sell the grinders for $40 (100mm Ozito) with a 3 year warrenty. The warranty is handy, as the grinder stopped working within about 15 minutes. As a result, I&rsquo;ve been using a 230mm grinder with a 100mm wheel - which is like putting a car tire on a road train.</p>

<p>Bunnings also sell the diamond grinding wheels - for $70. You can get two diamond grinding wheels from Ebay for $32.</p>

<p>If you think the other tools made a lot of dust, you ain&rsquo;t see nothing yet. This tool will turn everything in your house grey. I fabricated a ghetto dust hood using a clear plastic container, duct tape, and a shop vac. At the very least you will want to cover everything you own with drop sheets.</p>

<p>You can use a spray bottle and water to keep the dust down (and keep the wheel cool) - just don&rsquo;t get the grinder wet, you don&rsquo;t want to electrocute yourself (hopefully). If you do go down this path (water, not electocution), you will get &ldquo;mud&rdquo; flug out the side of the grinder. You can use cardboard to &ldquo;fence&rdquo; your work area and protect your walls.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: Works great, but dusty</strong></p>

<h2 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h2>

<p>You will have a lot of broken tiles, a lot of dust, and big piles of thinset. If possible, get a skip. If not, you are going to have to borrow a ute and do a dump run.</p>

<p>To clean the room, follow this process (Ensure you have your dust mask on):</p>

<ol>
<li>Manually carry all the larger tile pieces out to your dumping pile</li>
<li>Use an outdoor broom (the wider the better) to sweep up all the dust and thinset, then shovel it straght into a wheel barrow. This stuff can probably be used as fill or drainage aggregate - or just dumped.</li>
<li>Use your indoor broom to sweep up. The softer bristles should pick up a lot of crud.</li>
<li>Use a shop vac to pickup anything remaining. You could use your regular vacuum, but don&rsquo;t come crying to me if Mr Dyson explodes.</li>
<li>Mop.</li>
</ol>

<p>This may seem excessive, but if you don&rsquo;t follow these steps, you will have dust everywhere. You will be finding dust in 6 months time.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This has taken a lot longer than I planned. It has taken 3 or 4 full days and a lot of running around. My house is dusty, and my family is living on concrete floors. Before you go down this path <strong>really</strong> think about whether you have enough time and patience.</p>

<p>Would I still have done it, knowing what I know now? yes. Would I do it again in another house? probably not.</p>
