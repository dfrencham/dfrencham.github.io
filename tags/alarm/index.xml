      <description>I woke up one day with the thought &amp;ldquo;Gee, it would be nice to have my house alarm send notifications&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;. which seems like a simple enough idea in theory. Unfortunately the Alarm industry has other ideas.
It&amp;rsquo;s 2019. I have wifi enabled light bulbs I can control with my phone&amp;hellip; yet my home alarm system still doesn&amp;rsquo;t have TCP/IP connectivity. Surely newer models are better? maybe with a nice REST api?</description>

      <description>TLDR; I have alarm notifications set up on a linux box.
My home alarm is from a time when an alert meant &amp;ldquo;dial a security company&amp;rdquo;. Having email alerts instead makes sense&amp;hellip;. at least to me. Unfortunately the Alarm industry has other ideas.
IoT has exploded. I have wifi enabled light bulbs I can control with my phone&amp;hellip; yet my home alarm system still doesn&amp;rsquo;t have TCP/IP connectivity. Surely newer models include a web interface?</description>
