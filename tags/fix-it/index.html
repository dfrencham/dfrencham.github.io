</div>
    <p>Is your old exhaust fan too noisy? does it let cold air through from your ceiling cavity? Exhaust fans are easy to replace. I&rsquo;ll show you how.</p>

<div class="bg-warning messagebox round"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle left pad 10"></i><strong class="leftpad5">Warning</strong>
<div class="pad10">Ensure the power is off to the exhaust fan before you do any work on it. Go to your electrical box and turn off the circuit the fan is on. It may be on the light circuit or one of your power circuits. If you are in doubt, don't do any work. If you're Australian, all electrical work involving wiring must be performed by a licenced electrician.</div>
</div>

<p>So, can you do the work yourself? It depends what sort of power cable you have. Climb into your ceiling and have a look. If you can see a single thick cable in the ceiling, and it is connected to an outlet - you can do the work yourself. If you can see a cable that appears to be 3 separate cables joined together, then what you have is &ldquo;twin and earth&rdquo;. That means the fan is hard wired, and you should call an electrician.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-replace-it">How to Replace it</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-measure">Step 1. Measure</h3>

<p>Grab a ruler and measure the diameter of your existing fan opening (take the cover off first). Now go to the store and buy a new exhaust fan the same diameter. Note that some come with ducting and some don&rsquo;t. In my state, it is legal (and usual) to vent straight into the ceiling cavity - so I haven&rsquo;t bothered installing a duct. Make sure you get an exhaust fan with a &ldquo;draft stopper&rdquo; built in.</p>

<p>A draft stopper is a small, spring-loaded flap that starts off closed, but when the fan is on the flap opens and allows air to pass through. This stops ceiling drafts coming back down during winter and freezing you.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/exhaust-fan1.jpg" alt="original fan" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-unscrew-the-old-fan">Step 2. Unscrew the old fan</h3>

<p>Before you do this, get up in the ceiling and unplug the exhaust fan. Now you can safely remove the fan.</p>

<p>There will be a series of screws around the rim of the fan. These screws are connected to small clamps/brackets. Support the fan with one hand, and work your way around the fan, unscrewing as you go.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/exhaust-fan2.jpg" alt="original fan with cover off" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-remove-the-old-fan">Step 3. Remove the old fan</h3>

<p>Now you should be able to lift the old fan out.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/exhaust-fan3.jpg" alt="original fan with cover off" /></p>

<h3 id="step-4-install-the-new-fan">Step 4. Install the new fan</h3>

<p>Have a look at the new fan <strong>before</strong> you install it. Pay special attention to the clips that secure the fan to the ceiling. They should all be tucked in. As soon as you start turning the screws, they will pop out to clamp the fan in place.</p>

<p>Lift the power cord through first. If you can safely plug the fan in, do it now - then lift the fan into place and tighten all of the screws around the rim.</p>

<p>Make sure the fan is secure before you move your hands away.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/exhaust-fan4.jpg" alt="original fan with cover off" /></p>

<h3 id="step-5-install-new-cover">Step 5. Install new cover</h3>

<p>If you couldn&rsquo;t plug the fan in during installation, get in the ceiling now and plug it in.</p>

<p>Now you can turn the power circuits back on. Once on, go test the fan. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, turn the power back off and check the connections. If the connections are fine, you might have a dead fan (you will need to return it to the store).</p>

<p>If everything is working, push the new cover into place, turning as you push to lock it into place.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/exhaust-fan5.jpg" alt="original fan with cover off" /></p>

<p>Enjoy your new fan.</p>

    <p>Is your cupboard (or other) door scraping against the frame? All you need to fix it is a power plane (the type with a blade, not wings).</p>

<p>You can use a regular manual plane, but why would you? Power tools are fun.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-rubbing-door">The Problem - Rubbing Door</h2>

<p>Here is a photo of my linen cupboard. I&rsquo;ve circled the problem. The left hand door is scraping the other door. No amount of hinge adjustment or other messing around is going to fix this, we have to modify the door.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-1.jpg" alt="Our door is too big" /></p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-it">How to Fix it</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-mark-out-the-door">Step 1. Mark out the door</h3>

<p>Grab a ruler and draw a line, marking the amount of wood you want to remove. Note that if it is a hollow core door, there is a limit to how much you can remove. A few millimeters is going to be fine, but don&rsquo;t start taking huge chunks out. The door pictured is a hollow core door.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m removing about 1mm, to keep the gap between the doors as uniform as possible.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-2.jpg" alt="marking the door" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-remove-door">Step 2. Remove Door</h3>

<p>How to do this will vary depending on the type of hinge you have, but it is generally a matter of undoing the hinge screws, while not dropping the door on yourself.</p>

<p>If you are going to drop a door on yourself, try to ensure it is a hollow core door - they weigh far less than a solid core door.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-plane-the-door">Step 3. Plane the door</h3>

<p>Lay the door down so that the face you are planing is flat and easy to run the plane over. Ensure your power plane is set to take off a <em>small</em> amount of material (I went with a 0.2mm setting). This is to reduce the chance of damaging your door.</p>

<p>When you do plane the door, the direction should be from <strong>the outside in</strong>. When you lift the plane (after shaving some timber off), you should still to be on the door.</p>

<p>Keep planing until you reach the line you made in step 1.</p>

<p>If you run the plane the other way (off the end of the door), you greatly increase the chance of taking chunks out. This means your door will either be destroyed - or just look crap. You would need to use filler to fix it.</p>

<p>{% raw %}
<div class="bg-warning messagebox round"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle left pad 10"></i><strong class="leftpad5">Warning</strong>
<div class="pad10">A power plane is an unforgiving tool. It has a very sharp blade that rotates at 16,000 RPM. It is just as happy shaving your leg as it is shaving timber. Wear eye and ear protection, keep kids and pets away - and pay attention at all times.</div>
</div>
{% endraw %}</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-3.jpg" alt="plane goes this way" /></p>

<h3 id="step-4-admire-your-handywork-rehang-door">Step 4. Admire your handywork, rehang door</h3>

<p>Have a look at your door. Ensure you have taken off the right amount of material. I found that I needed to give the newly planed surface a quick sand with some 150 grit sandpaper to smooth it over a little (I probably need to sharpen my plane more often).</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-4.jpg" alt="nicely doored" /></p>

<p>Once you are satisfied, refit the door. Check that it now opens correctly. If not, take it down and go plane some more.</p>

<p>Update: @MaximRouiller informed me that I did not have a picture of the rehung door. Here it is&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plane-door-5.jpg" alt="rehung door" /></p>

<h3 id="step-5-paint">Step 5. Paint</h3>

<p>The final thing to do is repaint the planed edge of the door. Doors are usually painted with a high gloss enamel. If you want to match the paint, get a piece of paint that your plane has taken off, and have it matched at your local paint / hardware store.</p>

<p>Now you know how to fix a scraping door.</p>

    <p>Don&rsquo;t let a scraping, dragging door ruin your day. Let&rsquo;s replace the rollers!</p>

<p>Before you start, clean the track your door runs on. Your door may be scraping or dragging due to being caught on something. Have a good look at the raised &lsquo;rail&rsquo; the door roller sits on. If this is worn down too low, you&rsquo;ll need a whole new door track, not just a replacement roller.</p>

<h3 id="removing-the-door">Removing the Door</h3>

<p>Assuming the problem <em>is</em> your door roller - the first order of business is to remove the door. If it is a large glass door, it will weigh approximately 1 metric-shit-tonne. If you have help, use it.</p>

<p>Before removing the door, clear a space for it. It sucks to remove the door <em>then</em> realise you have nowhere to put the door down. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to put down a blanket to protect your floors. Metal framed doors can have sharp edges, and will happy scratch a deep groove into a timber or bamboo floor.</p>

<p>The actual removal process is fairly easy. Simply lift the door up into the frame - then (while keeping the door suspended in the air), bring the base of the door in towards you, as in the diagram below.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_removal_101.png" alt="removing the door" /></p>

<p>Once you have it out, lay the door on the long side. You&rsquo;ll find a screw. This screw will either be attached directly to the roller assembly, or pulling the door frame tight and clamping the roller assembly in place.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers2.jpg" alt="door rollers" /></p>

<p>Once you remove the screw, the roller assembly should slide out. Examine the roller wheel for wear and dirt. It may be worn down (you will need a new one). After cleaning any dirt out, it should spin freely. If not, you need a new one. If it does spin freely, it may have been sitting too high in the door.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers6.jpg" alt="old and new door rollers" /></p>

<p>If you need a new roller assembly, take the old one to a hardware store, and find the matching replacement part. Keep in mind that <em>your house is missing a door</em>, which will make it pretty easy for thieves - so hurry.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-the-roller-assembly">Replacing the roller assembly</h3>

<p>Putting the new roller assembly in simply reverses the process. Pay careful attention to how high the roller is sitting <strong>before</strong> you put the screw back in and tighten.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/door_rollers4.jpg" alt="new door roller" /></p>

<p>The roller needs to be sticking out the door enough that the door will move freely without scraping. Too high and you won&rsquo;t be able to get the door back in the frame. In my case, having the rollers protrude 3mm worked perfectly.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-windows">What about windows?</h3>

<p>Window rollers are replaced exactly the same way - assuming you have modern sliding windows. The only difference is that a window weighs less than a door, so it is easier to lift out.</p>

    <p>Kids destroy your expensive TV? Your $1700 TV? Good news dear reader. I&rsquo;ve found a way to stop it happening again.</p>

<p>The answer is perspex! (clear plastic acrylic).</p>

<p>Perspex is great stuff. If I could, everything my kids go near would be covered in perspex or bubble wrap. Might be easier to just bubble wrap my kids. Stay tuned for a future DIY article on that. In the mean time, I had a perspex TV cover made.</p>

<h2 id="plastic-fantastic">Plastic Fantastic</h2>

<p>After the sad demise of my TV, I started looking into a TV protector, and thought &ldquo;surely someone will make one?&rdquo;. Yes, they do. The problem is that they charge $250+ for it, then another $100+ shipping. They also use hopelessly thin perspex (3mm).</p>

<p>Time for Plan &ldquo;B&rdquo;. I sketched out a design for a TV cover and started calling plastic manufacturers in Brisbane.</p>

<p>My sketch:</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover06.jpg" alt="TV Cover design sketch" /></p>

<p>Result:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 companies didn&rsquo;t respond</li>
<li>2 companies couldn&rsquo;t do a 90 degree bend in perspex (?!)</li>
<li>2 companies wanted to charge stupidly high prices</li>
<li>1 company who could make it for a decent price</li>
</ul>

<p>Hamilton Plastics were able to produce exactly what I wanted. The price quoted was $160. Win! I submitted my order and waited.</p>

<h2 id="measure-twice">Measure TWICE</h2>

<p>I went to pick up the TV cover. Disaster! The top part (that overhangs the TV) was 3 times as long as it should have been. Turns out that I didn&rsquo;t double check my measurements. The cost of fixing the mistake was an extra $70. Damn.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-product">The Final Product</h2>

<p>Here are some photos of the final product:</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover03.jpg" alt="TV Cover side" /></p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover04.jpg" alt="TV Cover top" /></p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover05.jpg" alt="TV Cover base" /></p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover01.jpg" alt="TV Cover front" /></p>

<p>It is fairly simple design. The TV protector consists of a large perspex sheet (6mm thick) with a folded section at the top - which rests on top of the TV. All edges are rounded.</p>

<p>There are two straps ($10 cargo straps from Bunnings) which secure the screen protector to the TV. The straps loop through slits at the top and bottom of the protector.</p>

<p>I added some stick on rubber pads around the edge, to protect the cover and the TV.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/tvcover02.jpg" alt="TV Cover straps" /></p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How does the TV protector affect your viewing experience?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the protector for one year now, and I&rsquo;ve found that unless I look for it, I never even notice it is there. There is a <em>slight</em> increase in glare, but nothing that I&rsquo;ve found irritating.</p>

<p><strong>How well does it protect the TV?</strong></p>

<p>My 2 year old has hurled matchbox cars at it, the worst damage so far is a few light scratches. I don&rsquo;t notice them unless I get very close (within an arms length), and actively look for them.</p>

<p><strong>Is it heavy?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. I have my TV secured to the wall, so the weight isn&rsquo;t an issue. If the TV is on a stand, it would at least need to have a safety strap anchoring it to the wall - just to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t fall on your kid and/or cat.</p>

<p><strong>How do you clean it?</strong></p>

<p>I use a couple of cheap microfibre cloths. The first one is damp with a bit of water. The second is softer and used to give the cover a bit of a buff/polish.</p>

<p><strong>Will you sell me one?</strong></p>

<p>No, The shipping costs would be a nightmare.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get one?</strong></p>

<p>Call or email plastic fabricators in your area. Explain what you want, and send them a sketch with the dimensions. It may take a few calls though!</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;ve tried ripping anything off drywall (like Tiles for instance), you&rsquo;ve probably notice a problem. It utterly destroys the surface of the drywall. It is fairly easy to fix.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-things-you-need">Step 1 - Things you need</h2>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plaster01.jpg" alt="My wall had a bad day" /></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to need the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 plaster knives. These are not knives as in &lsquo;stab stab&rsquo;, these are broad and flat scraper like tools. Plastic versions cost about $5 each.</li>
<li>a tub of pre-mixed plaster. Get the &ldquo;final coat&rdquo; or &ldquo;top coat&rdquo; stuff. It spreads a lot more easily than the premixed &ldquo;multi-purpose&rdquo; version.</li>
<li>sanding block or paper</li>
</ul>

<p>First, use the sanding block to remove any bits of drywall paper that are sticking out, and generally smooth the surface. Don&rsquo;t be pedantic about it, spend a few minutes at most.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-get-your-plaster-ready">Step 2 - Get your plaster ready</h2>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plaster02.jpg" alt="Getting ready to plaster" /></p>

<p>Open your tub of plaster. Mix it around a bit if the liquid has seperated and is sitting on top. Now, to get plaster ready to spread on your plaster knife, you need to &ldquo;play&rdquo; with it a bit. Remember as a kid how you would roll around a ball of play-dough and swap it from hand to hand? Do something similar with your two plaster knives.</p>

<p>Scoop some plaster onto one knife, then scrape it on to the other knife, and vice versa. Doing this a few times makes sure it will be easy to spread.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-spread-the-plaster">Step 3 - Spread the plaster</h2>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plaster03.jpg" alt="spreading plaster" /></p>

<p>Make sure your blob of plaster is in the middle of the knife, then put the knife up to the wall and spread the plaster. You want a fairly thin (but even) coat. If you put it on too thick, you will need to do a lot of sanding after it dries.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plaster04.jpg" alt="Using the knife to smooth it out" /></p>

<p>After you have spread the plaster on the knife, use the second knife to scrape the first knife clean. Then use the clean knife to scrape the excess plaster off. You want enough pressure to scrape the surface smooth and flat, but not so much that you are exposing the old wall.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-let-it-dry">Step 4 - Let it dry</h2>

<p>Leave the plaster to dry overnight. You may or may not need a second coat. Give it a light sand to smooth it over. If the new coat is completely hiding the damaged wall, then you are good to go. If it is still showing through, repeat all steps.</p>

<p><img class="pure-img blog-img " src="/images/diy/plaster06.jpg" alt="Plastering done!" /></p>

<p>If the wall is not visibly smooth, keep sanding until it is.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-finishing">Step 5 - Finishing</h2>

<p>At this point you are good to prime and paint. If you want to match the existing paint, chip a little bit off and take it to a paint store (or Bunnings), they should be able to get a near perfect match.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re a plastering DIY expert. Awesome!</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m going to show you how to replace your old acrylic dome skylight. It sure beats a hole in the roof&hellip; unless you want a hole in your roof.</p>

<h2 id="skylights-are-not-always-standard-sized">Skylights are not always standard sized</h2>

<p>My house came with a 30 year old dome skylight. Rain, hail, even sufficiently sized bird crap made me nervous. I was worried that one day my skylight would disintegrate. This would devalue my property and may even let rain in. It would probably upset my wife too.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight01.jpg" alt="My skylight is crap" /></div>

<p>Should be easy to swap out right? just order one the same size, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>The size I have is 1200x700(ish), and that size is not made any more. Damn. This next best option is to replace the dome with a much better <em>tempered glass skylight</em>. These skylights are made by Velux, and available from Bunnings. Unfortunately they do not come in the right size either.</p>

<p>What we can do - is to buy a bigger skylight. Then we make a collar, which will sit on top of the existing skylight frame.</p>

<h2 id="which-skylight-do-i-need-to-buy">Which Skylight do I need to buy?</h2>

<p>Buy one that is both taller and wider than the model being replaced. When measuing your skylight, you will need to get on the room and measure from the edge of the dome (including the flashing securing it in place). At the same time, verify that there is actually a &ldquo;lip&rdquo; supporting the dome.</p>

<p>If your existing model does not have this lip, then this method will not work.</p>

<p>Buy the size closest to the old model as you can find. Don&rsquo;t bother getting a fancy model, just a plane one that doesn&rsquo;t open or have a curtain attached, or anything. Keep things easy.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-collar">Building the collar</h2>

<p>Here is the plan for the collar, which will support the new skylight:</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight-plan.jpg" alt="Collar plan" /></div>

<p>My initial plan was to use aluminium L-channel to fabricate the collar. I used my sliding mitre saw to cut the L-channel. Since aluminium is a soft metal, it cuts just fine with the wood blade. Make sure you wear safety glasses, and a face shield if you have one. As with all cutting, the material being cut can catch and be flung by the blade. A sharp aluminium off-cut in the face could kill you, or at least ruin your day.</p>

<p>I mitred all 4 sides, positioned inside the skylight, and screwed the L-channel in place.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight02.jpg" alt="Whacked out collar" /></div>

<p>Nice L-Channel corner eh? Perfectly mitred! Sadly, my existing skylight sits close to the roof tiles&hellip; which means that this collar caused the new skylight to sit <strong>on</strong> the roof tiles.  That&rsquo;s no good (for many reasons, including water run off).</p>

<p>To fix the height issue, I added a timber frame:</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight03.jpg" alt="Timber frame" /></div>

<h2 id="removing-the-old-skylight">Removing the old Skylight</h2>

<p>This is going to be a one attempt only affair. Your old dome skylight will probably be brittle, and quite likely to crack/break when you remove it.</p>

<p>Removing the skylight will vary between models. As a general rule, there is a lip holding the dome in place. The lip will be screwed or riveted down. In my case, I had to drill out about 10 rivets, which allowed me to remove the dome.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight05.jpg" alt="Timber frame" /></div>

<h1 id="installing-the-new-skylight">Installing the new skylight</h1>

<p>{% raw %}
<div class="bg-warning messagebox round"><strong>Skylights are heavy</strong><p />
Skylights are heavy, and awkward. A larger model, could be 50kg or more. Get help lifting it in place.</div>
{% endraw %}</p>

<p>If your measurements are right, the skylight collar should fit over the top of the old opening.</p>

<p>The new collar now needs to be secured. Screw the skylight frame into the collar. The skylight should have pre drilled holes you can use.</p>

<p>To secure the skylight to the old opening, you will need to put some screws up through the old lip, and into the collar. If you can&rsquo;t fit a drill or screw driver under the collar, use hex head screws or bolts. That way you can use hex/allan keys, or a socket set to secure the skylight.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img class="pure-img blog-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/diy/skylight06.jpg" alt="Skylight in place" /></div>

<p>Too easy, eh? Now I&rsquo;m ready for storm season.</p>

    <p>The Nexus4 is a great phone. Unfortunately it is a little bit fragile. I fell asleep with my N4 in my pocket&hellip; woke up, and the back had a crack. My wife dropped her N4 and the screen shattered.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to walk you through how to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-fix-it">Should You fix it?</h2>

<p>First, be aware that you are going to need up to AUD$100 in parts. You may need to get another $20 worth of tools.</p>

<p>If you pay someone to fix it, the cost is around $160.</p>

<p>You need to decide if it is worth paying an extra $40-$60 to have someone else do the repair. If I had to decide again, I would probably just pony up the extra cash.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-repair-your-phone">How to Repair Your Phone</h2>

<h3 id="risks">Risks</h3>

<p>You have a real risk of breaking other parts of your phone. I managed to break the antenna cable - and had to wait 2 weeks for another one to ship.</p>

<p>Break the wrong part, and you will wish you paid someone else to do it for you.</p>

<h3 id="parts">Parts</h3>

<p>I went with <a href="http://www.etradesupply.com/oem-lg-nexus-4-e960-lcd-screen-and-digitizer-assembly-with-front-housing.html">this complete assembly</a> from Etradesupply. There are a lot of second rate screens on ebay that have bad digitizers. This one seems to be genuine, and it comes as a complete front assembly. Having the full front assembly is much easier doing a straight screen swap.</p>

<p>The cost was AUD$80 plus AUD$20 shipping. The shipping cost sounds expensive, but it arrived within a week (most of the time anything from China/HK takes 3-6 weeks).</p>

<h4>Spreader Tool</h4>
You will need one of these to crack open the case. Yes, you can use a flathead screw driver like I did, but you shouldn't, because you will scratch the case.
</li>
<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n4tools04.jpg" title="Screw drivers."><img src="/images/sm_n4tools04.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Screw drivers" /></a>
<h4>Screw Drivers</h4>
You need a good set of small size screw drivers, including a phillips (cross) head, and a T5 Torx. See below for a close up.
</li>
<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n4tools02.jpg" title="Torx. Even the name sounds cool."><img src="/images/sm_n4tools02.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Torx screw driver." /></a>
<h4>Torx Screw Driver</h4>
A Torx is like a phillips head that doesn't slip and strip the screw head.

<h4>Magnetic Pickup & Tweezers</h4>
The screws are pretty small, so a magnetic pickup tool is a good idea. You will need tweezers to unplug some of the more fiddly cables.
</li>
</ul>

  <img src="/images/sm_n402.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Borked phone" />
  </a>
  <h4>1</h4> 
Find a comfy spot and a level surface. 
</li>

  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n403.jpg" title="Removing the sim card">
  <img src="/images/sm_n403.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Removing the sim card" />
  </a>
  <h4>2</h4> 
Remove the sim tray. If you can't find your sim eject tool, a paper clip will do. If you forget this step, you will break off part of the back cover. 
</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n404.jpg" title="T5 torx screws">
  <img src="/images/sm_n404.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="T5 torx screws" />
  </a>
  <h4>3</h4> 
See these two small screws on the bottom of the phone? Use a T5 torx screwdriver to remove them. 
</li>

  <img src="/images/sm_n405.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cracking the seal. With a club. boomtish*" />
  </a>
  <h4>4</h4> 
Time to crack the seal. You should start from the bottom of the phone. Don't be a dodgy bastard like me (using a flathead screw driver), use a plastic wedge tool (available on ebay for about $5).
</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n406.jpg" title="Using my professional tool kit to open the phone.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n406.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Using my professional tool kit to open the phone." />
  </a>
  <h4>5</h4> 
I used a plastic card to work my way around the rest of the phone. It takes a surprising amount of effort to remove the back cover. **If you are only replacing the back cover, you can put it on now and re-assemble.** 
</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n407.jpg" title="N4 in various states of undress.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n407.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="N4 in various states of undress." />
  </a>
  <h4>6</h4> 
The image shows the new screen assembly (middle) next to the phone (right). Remove the screws holding the L-shaped plastic cover on the right. Be careful not to strip any. The top left screw may be a little more difficult to remove than the others." 

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n408.jpg" title="I&#39;m a derp, and I stripped a screw.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n408.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="I&#39;m a derp, and I stripped a screw." />
  </a>
  <h4>7</h4> 
This is what happens when you strip a screw. It's not the end of the world, but I did have to drill it out. The top left screw seems to be the most difficult to remove.

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n409.jpg" title="Battery.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n409.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Battery." />
  </a>
  <h4>8</h4> 
Use a wedge tool to leaver out the battery. It has a fair bit of glue, so it will take some wiggling about. Do not use anything sharp - you don't want to pierce the battery. Bad things will happen (I think demons fly out).

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n410.jpg" title="Speaker module">
  <img src="/images/sm_n410.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Speaker module" />
  </a>
  <h4>9</h4> 
Remove the 2 phillips head screws holding the speaker module down. Use tweezers to disconnect the ribbon cable at the top of the module, then carefully pry the module out. Use a wedge tool. There is a little bit of glue holding it in place. 

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n411.jpg" title="Logic boards">
  <img src="/images/sm_n411.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Logic boards" />
  </a>
  <h4>10</h4> 
Use tweezers to remove the antenna cable. I didn't, it broke, and I had to wait for 2 weeks while a replacement was shipped. Use the tweezers to remove all the connectors going to the logic boards, then lift out the logic boards. 

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n412.jpg" title="Little grey thing">
  <img src="/images/sm_n412.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Little grey thing" />
  </a>
  <h4>11</h4> 
See this little grey thing? Pay attention to how it sits, and don't lose it. It is needed by the front facing camera.

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n413.jpg" title="Switches">
  <img src="/images/sm_n413.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Switches" />
  </a>
  <h4>12</h4> 
Here is the volume rocker. The power switch is similar. Have a good look at how they sit, then remove with tweezers. If not mounted exactly the same way, they won't work.

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n415.jpg" title="New front assembly">
  <img src="/images/sm_n415.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="New front assembly" />
  </a>
  <h4>13</h4> 
This is the new front assembly. You will notice a couple of 3M glue stickers. Make sure you remove them before mounting anything over them.

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n416.jpg" title="Assembled front assembly.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n416.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Assembled front assembly." />
  </a>
  <h4>14</h4> 
Reassemble everything in reverse order on the new front assembly. Remember to be careful with that antenna cable. Make sure you power up and test the buttons before you snap the back cover on.

</li>

<li>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/n417.jpg" title="Fixed phone, next to old broken screen.">
  <img src="/images/sm_n417.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Fixed phone, next to old broken screen." />
  </a>
  <h4>15</h4> 
Here is the fixed phone. There are no additional steps, it should happily power on (if it has charge). The most likely issues you will come across are: your buttons don't work right (make sure the pins have good contact); the camera doesn't work (did you connect all of the ribbon cables?).

    <p>Have you ever seen just how curious a 4 year old can be? My 4 year old wondered what was under the impossible-to-replace vitreous china Cistern lid. As a result, I needed a new cistern lid (my 4 year old survived unscathed).</p>

<p>Turns out that you can&rsquo;t buy a Cistern lid in Brisbane, so read on and learn how to replace the entire toilet cistern&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>Here is a picture of my old cistern lid:</p>

<div class="post-image">
<a class="fancybox" href="images/toilet07.jpg" title="Hey what's under this lid? SMASH"><img class="pure-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/sm_toilet07.jpg" alt="Smashed cistern lid" /></a><br />
</div>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>I decided to try and fix it. Multiple people advised me that this was a bad idea, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it. I ignored common sense, experience, and reason and pressed onward.</p>

<p>I glued the lid back together with epoxy. I sanded it. It fell apart. I re-glued it with building glue. I made the mistake of not using expoxy filler and tried to compensate with extra paint (expoxy enamel).</p>

<p><strong>Do not try to fill gaps with extra paint.</strong></p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work. You end up with a layer of thick ugly paint, which may be liquid paint underneath. The finish will be terrible. You will need to sand it. I ended up with this abomination:</p>

<div class="post-image">
<a class="fancybox" href="images/toilet01.jpg" title="Badly painted cistern lid"><img class="pure-img img-thumbnail" src="/images/sm_toilet01.jpg" alt="Badly painted cistern lid" /></a><br />
</div>

<p>I tried to sand it, but the paint hadn&rsquo;t bonded properly, causing patching of it to lift. There&rsquo;s a reason why people tell you not to paint ceramic/china toilets.</p>

<p>Time for Plan B!</p>

<p>I managed to find a whole new Cistern on <a href="http://www.gumtree.com.au">Gumtree</a> for $20. Brand new, never used, but from a different model of toilet. I checked out the measurements on Caroma&rsquo;s website, and it seemed like a close fit - with only 1mm difference between the mounting holes. Caroma were able to confirm that was a match.</p>

<p>If you are buying a Cistern, measure up the mounting holes for your old cistern (the holes in the top of the toilet bowl), then call the manufacturer to confirm that it is compatible. You will save yourself a lot of potential pain.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<ul>
<li>2 x Shifter spanner (to remove the water line)</li>
<li>Power drill/driver</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>

<ul class="howto">

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/toilet02.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_toilet02.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="sizing up the enemy" /></a>
<h4>1</h4>
The before shot. Turn off the water line next to the toilet. Unscrew the seat (this is usually a couple of thumb screws underneath the hinge at the back). Flush the toilet to clear out the excess water.
<p />Use the shifter spanner to undo the water line. There should be a braided line with a screw on connector. You can use the 2 shifter spanners to undo that connector. Use one to hold the connector, and the other to unscrew the fitting.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/toilet03.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_toilet03.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="removing the cistern" /></a>
<h4>2</h4>
There should be screw(s) holding the cistern to the wall. Remove them, taking care to catch the cistern if it falls away from the wall. In my case I found a large amount of silicon as well, which I have to remove with a knife. Lift the cistern off the bowl. Once the cistern is out of the way, take this opportunity to clean around the bowl where the seat normally sits.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/toilet04.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_toilet04.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Fitting the new cistern" /></a>
<h4>3</h4>
<p>To secure the new cistern, there are 2 attachment points. The cistern will have 2 bolts that go through matching holes on the bowl, and there will be the screw points on the cistern. Lift the cistern into place (putting the bolts through the holes). Holding the cistern in place with one hand, use your other hand to screw the nuts onto the end of the bolts. Only hand tighten at this point.</p>

<p>In the photo, note the metal bracket I used to secure the cistern to the wall. Any flat piece of metal will do, I just used a spare bracket I had lying around. Use an appropriately sized screw and fix to a wall stud if possible, or use a plasterboard anchor.</p>
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/toilet05.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_toilet05.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="put it all back together" /></a>
<h4>4</h4>
Use your shifter spanner to tighten up the bolts you placed under the bowl earlier. Be very careful not to over-tighten, or you <b>will</b> break the bowl. Attach the water line using the reverse process to step one. Turn it on and allow the cistern to fill. If you see water leaking, turn the tap off immediately and check that the connections are tight enough.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/toilet06.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_toilet06.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="all done" /></a>
<h4>5</h4>
Put the lid on, and give it a test flush. Reattach the seat. All done! Easy, right?

    <p>When I moved into my house 2 years ago, it had one glaring problem&hellip;. a strip of rust around the front of the bathroom basin. Because I&rsquo;m not the best at prioritising things (and there happened to be some great sales on Steam, and I have 2 young kids, etc etc), my solution was to put a piece of white duct tape over it for 2 years and get on with my life.</p>

<p>I happened to impulse buy a sink a few weeks ago (I had the old sink measurements saved on my phone!), I decided to have a go at installing it.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>You only need two tools for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 adjustable spanners (wrench for our friends in the US and Canada)</li>
<li>a paddle pop stick (yes really)</li>
<li>a spray bottle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="missteps">Missteps</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to stuff this up. Learn from my stupidity&hellip;</p>

<ul class="howto">
<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink07.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink07.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="stupid sink was too small" /></a>
<div><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign warning-icon"></span> <span class="bigtext">Measure twice</span></div>
Most import, make sure you have measured the basin accurately! I thought I had, but actually hadn't - so I had to rush to Bunnings 30 minutes before closing.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink09.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink09.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="stupid wrong connections" /></a>
<div><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign warning-icon"></span> <span class="bigtext">Check your connectors</span></div>
Make sure you have the right hose/pipe fittings! I didn't the first time. My taps and my water connection both had *female* fittings - so it was off to bunnings again for a coupler (those 2 things in the middle of the photo)
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-to-fit-that-basin">Time to fit that basin!</h3>

<ul class="howto">

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink02.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink02.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="sizing up the enemy" /></a>
<h4>1</h4>
Take a final look at your old sink, yes that is duct tape. Yes, I am embarrassed.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink01.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink01.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="water off" /></a>
<h4>2</h4>
Turn your water off. Some of you will be lucky enough to have a tap under your sink to do this. I don't, so I had to shut off supply for the whole house.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink06.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink06.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="sink gone. goodbye." /></a>
<h4>3</h4>
The old sink may have a few clips holding in place underneath. Undo those. The old tapware will (hopefully) have braided lines with screw on connections. These can be removed with a shifter spanner. If you have copper lines that are soldered in place, you are going to need a plumber to replace them with braided lines. <p />Once the taps are disconnected, and any screws undone, unscrew the pipe connected to the drain. I found wrapping a rag around it helped me get enough grip to unscrew it. If you are wondering, that is rust around my old sink.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink03.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink03.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="setup new sink" /></a>
<h4>4</h4>
Before putting your new basin ready, we need to fit the tap and drain. Before you do that, measure the old sink hole to check the new basin will fit. <p />
Your new tap will look something like this, with two braided lines (hot and cold).
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink04.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink04.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="don't over tighten the taps" /></a>
<h4>5</h4>
Slide the braided lines from the tap through the hole in the sink. Note in the photo the brass nut. That has to end up <b>underneath</b> the sink. Once you have done that, use the shifter spanner to tighten that brass nut. The idea is that you tighten it just enough to stop the tap rotating. If you over tighten, the sink will crack, so go easy here mate.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink05.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink05.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="put the drain in" /></a>
<h4>6</h4>
Screw the drain into the bottom of the basin. Some basins come with a drain, some have to be purchased separately. Generally, they all require you to push the drain in from the top, and then screw one or more plastic rings onto the bottom (sometimes with a rubber washer between the sink and screw on ring.)
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink10.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink10.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="bad pipe work" /></a>
<h4>7</h4>
Now you can settle your sink into place. Connect up your braided lines first. I hit a snag here. Both ends of the braided line had female connectors. This is where I had to go back to Bunnings and get a female-to-female coupler.
<p />
Once you have done that, it's time to connect the drain. Notice something about the pipes under my sink? They suck. Yeah, they probably could be fixed, but a new trap is all of $5. Do yourself a favour and buy one.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink11.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink11.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="nice new trap" /></a>
<h4>8</h4>
This is in the new trap, ain't she a beauty. If you are wondering, this is an S-Trap. An S-Trap does a full S, with the entrance pointing up, and the exit pointing down. If the exit points sideways, you have a P-Trap.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink16.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink16.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="plumbing done" /></a>
<h4>9</h4>
Here is the new trap plumbed in. On the bottom left, I used a 90 degree bend with an inspection opening. The inspection opening is handy if anything gets stuck in the bend or I need to clean the pipe. I also used a straight section of pipe and joined it to the existing with a slip coupling. Anything that can't be screwed together is held in place with plumbers cement - that blue glue seen in the picture. For cutting pipes, a hacksaw works best.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink17.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink17.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="nice sink" /></a>
<h4>10</h4>
Nearly done, but missing one thing - silicone! <br />
(Note: you may notice that the basin has mysteriously changed between here and step 6. I had to swap it with a different basin because I didn't measure properly, and the first basin was too small!)
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink14.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink14.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="putting on silicone" /></a>
<h4>11</h4>
I used Parfix Bathroom and Kitchen silicone, with the cheap $5 caulking gun from Bunnings. Make sure the area is dry before you start. You will need more than you think - we are going to wipe the excess off and smooth it after application. You want enough to fill the gap between the basin and the bench top. After you run the initial ring around the basin, spray it with a light mist of dish washing detergent and water.
<p />
Use a paddle pop stick over the silicone to give it a nice smooth edge. You will need to wipe the excess off on a rag pretty frequently. This detergent stops the silicone from bonding with the paddlepop stick.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/sink18.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_sink18.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="stupid wrong connections" /></a>
<h4>12</h4>
Ta-Da!

    <p>A bad shower head is more annoying than you might think. It&rsquo;s something we use every day, but it amazes me how many people will put up with a rubbish shower head for years. You wouldn&rsquo;t put up with a crappy text editor for that long, would you?</p>

<p>It takes 10 minutes to replace, so lets get started!</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>You only need two tools for this:
- adjustable spanner (wrench for our friends in the US and Canada)
- knife or flat head screw driver</p>

<p>You may notice instead of a spanner, I&rsquo;m using a rusty pair of vice grips. The photos below were taken at a family member&rsquo;s house&hellip; possibly the only house I&rsquo;ve found without a spanner.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ul class="howto">
<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower01.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower01.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Old shower-head" /></a>
<h4>1</h4>Here is the shower head we are going to replace.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower02.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower02.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Not using a spanner" /></a>
<h4>2</h4> Turn the nut at the base of the shower head in a counter-clockwise direction (lefty-loosey, righty tighty!). Use the spanner for this, not the vice grips pictured.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower04.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower04.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Removing stuck trim" /></a>
<h4>3</h4>The trim piece is usually stuck on pretty well with a combination of rust and 10 years of soap. A butter knife or flathead screw driver will come in handy to remove it.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower05.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower05.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Taping it up" /></a>
<h4>4</h4>Wrap some plumbers tape around the pipe to get a good seal. Your new shower head probably comes with some plumbers tape.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower06.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower06.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Screwing the fitting in." /></a>
<h4>5</h4>Put the new trim piece over the pipe, then screw the new shower fitting on (in a clockwise direction). Hand tighten it. If it feels secure and doesn't leak, hand tightening is fine. Otherwise lightly tighten with your spanner (if you do this, put a bit of masking tape on the shower fitting first - so you don't scratch the chrome finish).
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower08.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower08.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Admiring the finished item." /></a>
<h4>6</h4>Ta-Da!. Check for leaks, then have a well deserved beer/Coke/RedBull.
</li>
