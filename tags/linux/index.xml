      <description>Last time I set up inverter monitoring for my Aurora solar inverter, it had a lot of moving parts. I had a RaspberryPi ModelB hosting utilities writing to CSV files, which were periodically scooped up by a monitoring service. The monitoring service had a bit of setup and a few issues, but in the end it would get the data up to PVOutput.org.
This time around I decided to cut out all the bullshit and write to the PVOutput API with as little fuss as possible.</description>
